# Mini-Projects

This repository contains practice mini-projects and exercises that I have worked on to strengthen my fundamentals and gain hands-on experience in development. Each project is a small, focused implementation that helped me understand core concepts and build a strong command over various technologies.

## Purpose

- To document and organize my mini-projects.
- To track my progress while practicing different development skills.
- To serve as a reference for building real-world applications in the future.

Each folder in this repository represents a separate mini-project. 


## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, SCSS
- JavaScript
- Frontend frameworks and libraries (if any)
- Git and GitHub for version control
